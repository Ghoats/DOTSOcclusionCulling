# DOTSOcclusionCulling
A working example of realtime raycast-based Occlusion Culling using Jobs/Burst

Still needs some tidying up, allowing for re-use of array entries and also there's probably some more optimisation to make but it's roundabout there.
Because it's raycast-based, it works better on larger objects such as buildings.

I'm currently in the process of trying to optimise it via octrees, but obviously that has it's own complications.
